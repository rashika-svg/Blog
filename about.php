                The most effective way to boost your site’s ranking in the organic or natural search engine listings is
                to determine the search phrases (keywords) most likely to be used by prospective customers and then
                write your site content using those keywords. This is the foundation of what is known as search engine
                optimization, or “SEO”. This applies
                to the text that will be rendered in HTML on a web page. Search engines do not understand text shown as
                a graphic.
